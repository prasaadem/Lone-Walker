# Lone Walker

This project is a navigation based application using CoreLocation, MapKit frameworks. It fetches the users current location and destination location. It finds the shortest path between these two locations, displays it on MapView.

In addition to displaying the route, the app makes a series of server calls to OpenWeatherMap API to fetch the current weather information in that particular route and displays that information in a tabluar data.
